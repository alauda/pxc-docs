# Architecture

Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) is an open-source solution designed to provide high availability and scalability for MySQL databases. It integrates Percona Server with the Galera library, enabling synchronous multi-master replication to ensure data consistency across all nodes.

## Features of Percona XtraDB Cluster

| Feature                          | Details |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| **Synchronous replication**      | Data is written to all nodes simultaneously, or not written at all in case of a failure even on a single node. |
| **Multi-source replication**     | Any node can trigger a data update. |
| **True parallel replication**    | Multiple threads on replica performing replication on row level. |
| **Automatic node provisioning**  | You simply add a node and it automatically syncs. |
| **Data consistency**             | No more unsynchronized nodes. |
| **PXC Strict Mode**              | Avoids the use of tech preview features and unsupported features. |
| **Optimized Performance**        | Percona XtraDB Cluster performance is optimized to scale with a growing production workload. |
