# User Management

## Function Overview

This feature provides a graphical user management function. It is recommended that you assign database users correspondingly to database developers based on usage needs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the instance is in **Running** status.

## Create User

Create a user and configure permissions for that user. The platform will simultaneously generate user authentication credentials for Kubernetes resources - **Secret Dictionary**. For applications using MySQL, MySQL username and password can be referenced in Pods through the Secret Dictionary. The Secret Dictionary will automatically synchronize user information; do not modify the configurations within it.

    #### Create User

    1. Click **MySQL-PXC** in the left navigation bar.

    2. Click ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Click ***Instance Name***.

    4. In the **User Management** tab, click **Create User**.

    5. Set user information.

       **Note**: Please securely store your password. To reduce the risk of password leakage, it is recommended to update the password regularly.

    7. Click **Create**.

    #### Add Secret Dictionary (for Non-Platform Created Users)

    If a database user was created through a non-platform method, please manually create the corresponding Secret Dictionary for them. The **Secret Dictionary** is the user authentication credentials used by Kubernetes resources. If an application needs to use MySQL, the MySQL username and password can be referenced in Pods through the Secret Dictionary.

    1. Click **MySQL-PXC** in the left navigation bar.

    2. Click ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Click ***Instance Name***.

    4. In the **User Management** tab, click ***User Name***.

    5. Enter the password set during user creation, then click **Add**.

    #### Update User

    1. Click **MySQL-PXC** in the left navigation bar.

    2. Click ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Click ***Instance Name***.

    4. Go to the **User Management** tab.

       - To update the password: click **Update Password** next to the user.

       - To update user permissions (for non-**root** users): click ***User Name***, then in the user details, click **Update Permissions**.

    5. Modify the configurations.

    6. Click **Update**.
