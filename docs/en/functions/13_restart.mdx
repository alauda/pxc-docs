# Restart Instance

## Function Overview

If an instance encounters operational faults, excessive connection counts, or other unknown issues that cannot be identified during its operation, problems can be resolved by restarting the instance.

## Precautions

During the restart process, Pods will be restarted one by one, which may cause a temporary interruption of services.

## Prerequisites

The instance must be in a Running state.

**Note:**

If the instance is in a Processing state, it indicates that the instance might be starting normally; please be patient.

If the instance fails to start or is abnormal, meaning the instance is in a Processing or Error state, it will automatically restart after the health check times out; please be patient.
