# Stop and Start Instance


The one-click start and stop feature meets the daily development and operation maintenance needs, allowing you to quickly pause or resume middleware instances. In scenarios such as scheduled downtime, heavy node load, and development testing environments, you may need to temporarily release CPU and memory resources without deleting instances. The one-click start and stop feature helps you save resources and flexibly manage instances, thereby reducing costs and improving efficiency.
## Prerequisites

Stopping an instance requires the instance to be in **Processing**, **Running**, **Abnormal**, or **Unknown** status.

Starting an instance requires the instance to be in **Stopping** or **Stopped** status.
