# 监控

## 功能简介
内嵌面板中的监控数据可用于从资源、性能及容量等方面进行 MySQL 监控与告警，且支持配置通知策略。

直观呈现的监控数据可用于为运维巡检或性能调优提供决策支持。

### 性能监控面板

平台默认收集 MySQL 的资源、性能及容量相关常用监控指标。在实例的 **监控** 页签中，可查看指标的实时监控数据。


| 指标 | 默认监控指标                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pod CPU Utilization | Pod's CPU usage. Pods with a CPU usage exceeding 100% will be ignored, because under normal circumstances the CPU usage will not exceed 100%. If it exceeds 100%, please check whether all containers of pod have set resource limits. |
| Pod Memory Utilization | Pod's memory usage. Pods with a memory usage exceeding 100% will be ignored, because under normal circumstances memory usage will not exceed 100%. If it exceeds 100%, please check whether all containers of pod have set resource limits. |
| Netwrok Received | The average bytes per second received from network in the past 5 minutes |
| Netwrok Transmitted | The average bytes per second sent onto network in the last 5 minutes |
| PVC Used | PVC storage usage. |
| MySQL Connections | Max Connections is the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. By default, this is 151. Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires. |
| MySQL Client Thread Activity | Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads not sleeping. |
| MySQL Table Locks | MySQL takes a number of different locks for varying reasons. In this graph we see how many Table level locks MySQL has requested from the storage engine. |
| MySQL Sorts | This graph also shows when sorts had to scan a whole table or a given range of a table in order to return the results and which could not have been sorted via an index |
| MySQL Slow Queries | Slow queries are defined as queries being slower than the long_query_time setting. |
| InnoDB Buffer Pool Requests | InnoDB Buffer Pool Requests refers to the total number of read and write requests made to the InnoDB buffer pool. |
| TPS | Transactions Per Second (TPS) is a key performance metric that measures the number of transactions MySQL processes per second. |
| Commands | Commands refers to the number of SQL statements executed by MySQL, including queries, inserts, updates, deletes, and other database operations. |
